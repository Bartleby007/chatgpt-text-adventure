# 🧭 10-Room Text Adventure Game

A simple browser-based text adventure game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Players explore 10 unique rooms using compass-style navigation. Each room has a short description and directional exits (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). This is a minimalist framework — no inventory, items, or puzzles (yet!).

---

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Read the room description.
3. Click on a direction button to move to the next location.
4. Buttons are enabled only if that direction is available from your current room.

## 🛠 How It Works

- `index.html`: Page layout and button structure
- `style.css`: Simple styling and compass layout
- `game.js`: Room logic and navigation engine
- `README.md`: This file ✨

## 🌱 Ideas for Expansion

- Add inventory and item interactions
- Create puzzles or locked doors
- Use images or ambient sound per room
- Add a "map" or "log" feature
- Save/load player state
